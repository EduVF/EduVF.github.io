            <h3>MACHINE</h3>
            <h4>a real-time battery-powered senseless selfish heart</h4>
            <p>is a piece written for <b>drums</b> and <b>live electronics</b>. The special part of it is that all the
                electronics are controlled using a pair of <b>Joy-Con controllers</b> from the Nintendo Switch game
                console. It works through Bluetooth, paired to a Python script that sends OSC messages to
                <b>SuperCollider</b>, the software that ultimately does the sound synthesis.
            </p>
            <p>
                The score uses a combination of traditional writing for the drums, and spectrum-like graphics for the
                electronic parts. However, both performers are encouraged to experiment with the system and work
                together to improvise and create their own interpretation of the music.
