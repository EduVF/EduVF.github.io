            <h3>MACHINE</h3>
            <h4>a real-time battery-powered senseless selfish heart</h4>
            <p>is a piece written for <b>drums</b> and <b>live electronics</b>. The special part of it is that all the
                electronics are controlled using a pair of <b>Joy-Con controllers</b> from the Nintendo Switch game
                console. It works through Bluetooth, paired to a Python script that sends OSC messages to
                <b>SuperCollider</b>, the software that ultimately does the sound synthesis.
            </p>
            <p>
                The score uses a combination of traditional writing for the drums, and spectrum-like graphics for the
                electronic parts. However, both performers are encouraged to experiment with the system and work
                together to improvise and create their own interpretation of the music.

            <h3>/aŭ.'to.ma.ta/</h3>
            <p>(also written simply as "automata") is a piece for <b>piano solo</b> and <b>electronics</b>. Two speakers
                are
                placed at each side of the piano, from the perspective of the audience, and the pianist uses a MIDI
                pedal to control a MaxMSP patch that triggers a series of audio samples. <i>The homogeneous timber
                    between the acoustic and the virtual piano gives a seamless sound that morphs organically.</i>

                the Nintendo Switch game console. It was first performed on and written for the "<b>Kebyart meets
                    ESMUC</b>" project, together with the <b>Kebyart saxophone quartet</b> and many saxophone students
